# 🧠 Eight Puzzle Solver — CS 205 Project 1

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an intelligent solver for the **8-puzzle problem** using the following search strategies:

-  **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
-  **A\* Search with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic**
-  **A\* Search with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic**

The code is written in **Python 3** and follows the *general search algorithm* described in the course.  
It is also **easily extendable** to support N-puzzles (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
